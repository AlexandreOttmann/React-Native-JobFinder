#JobFinder

Hello there :) This is my first React-Native Project. I want to apply as an intern to a company I really want to work with but I didn't learn React-Native yet so here we are! I'm building a job finder using different social media api. Following some tutorial and courses on it.

# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-react-native-app -t with-router
```
